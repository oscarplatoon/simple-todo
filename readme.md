# Simple Todo Page
We now have all the basic tools of the front end at our disposal. Let's put them to work by creating a To-Do List application.

## Steps:
* Create your HTML/CSS/JS files ****
* Display a list of items that you need to do. Use local storage to get/remove/add these items.
* Create a form at the bottom of the list to add more things to your todo list
* Create the ability to check off things from your todo list. When you check things off, make sure that has a ~~strikethrough~~ so that you know what you've already done. This will probably alter the data structure you have in local storage.
* Style it! Look into using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling in addition to vanilla css.

Step 1
Html - div of the form, ordered list/ add
CSS - styling of the form/button- bare skeleton
JS - DOM methods (getElementById(), document.getElementsByClassName(), document.getElementsByTagName(), document.querySelector(), document.querySelectorAll()); Local Storage (localStorage.setItem(key, value), 
value = localStorage.getItem(key)), window.localStorage(),  document.getElementById("myText").value = "Johnny Bravo";

*----form---- button - menu add/remove from list
